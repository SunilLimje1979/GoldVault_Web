		Meet Mrs. Sharda Luniya – an invaluable asset to Vighnaharta Gold and a dedicated advocate for environmental sustainability! As the Director, she has been instrumental in the success of the platform, working alongside her husband, Mr. Mahendra Luniya. With a passion for societal impact, Mrs. Luniya is an active member of the Rotary Club and leads numerous initiatives through the VGold Foundation.

		Her recent project focused on planting trees to create a canopy in a truck driving test area, reducing pollution and providing natural shade.

Mrs. Luniya’s efforts have made significant contributions to both the ecosystem and Vighnaharta Gold’s social responsibility mission.
